# MarkDown

### WHAT

Markdown is a lightweight <u>markup language</u> that you can use to add formatting elements to *plaintext* text documents.

---

### WHY

Markdown...

- .... can be used for **everything**
- ... is **portable**  (platform independent)
- ... is **future proof** (you can use a text editor)

---

### WHERE

Markdown is **everywhere** (Github, Reddit)

How we can relise links?

[Google](google.com)

<!-- [Qua scrivo il testo che voglio "hyperlinkare"](e qua metto il link effettivo) -->

What about formatting?

__Bold__

<!-- __bold__ -->

_italic_

<!-- _italic_ -->

<u>underlined</u>

<!-- <u>underlined</u> -->

~~dashed~~

<!-- ~~dashed~~ -->

_Of course we can mix __things__  ~~together __infinitly__~~_

Unnumbered list

- The
  - answer
    - is
      - alwasy
        - 42

Unfortunately there are only 3 different symbols fo lists


There are also numbered list
1. if we want
   1. to add
      1. a specific
      2. and detailed
   2. structure

---

We can create table

| header 1 | header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| cell1    | cell2    |

In the end, what about code snippet? Maybe... installation procedure?
```bash
$ pip install nomepacchetto
```
or spicy code?
```python
def hello():
  print("Hello world")
```
